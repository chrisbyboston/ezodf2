Introduction
============

The main intention of the **ezodf2** package is to **easy** read, write and
modify OpenDocument (ODF) files but without the goal to support all
possibilities that the OASIS OpenDocument Standard provides.

To be clear, it is safe to open and rewrite ODF files which contains
unsupported features, thanks to the documented container format
(PKZIP format) and the XML technology nothing get lost, even non-standard
data in the container file will preserved.

OpenDocument (ODF)
------------------

The Open Document Format for Office Applications (also known as OpenDocument
or ODF) is an XML-based file format for representing electronic documents
such as spreadsheets, charts, presentations and word processing documents.

While the specifications were originally developed by Sun Microsystems, the
standard was developed by the OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications
(OpenDocument) TC - OASIS ODF TC, committee of the Organization for the
Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) consortium and based
on the XML format originally created and implemented by the OpenOffice.org
office suite.

In addition to being an OASIS standard, it is published (in one of its version
1.0 manifestations) as an ISO/IEC international standard, ISO/IEC 26300:2006
Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0.
